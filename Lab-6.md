# Lab 6: Psychophysiological Interaction (PPI) Analyses and Independent Component Analysis (ICA)

## Learning Objectives

We’ve covered task-dependent activity analyses in previous labs. In this lab we’re going to look at methods involving *functional connectivity* and *ICA*:

- Make anatomical masks and extract signal for the seed region of PPI  
- Set up and describe the design matrix of PPI with interaction terms and seed regressor  
- Understand and interpret the FEAT report  
- Compare MELODIC ICA data exploration report with FEAT report

```

## Make Anatomical (i.e., Atlas-Based) Masks

In your *fsl* terminal: 
```bash
# Create and enter the folder for the lab
mkdir ~/Lab_6/
cd Lab_6

# Set brain atlas path: this path apply if you are using fsl-6.0.7.16; change fsl folder name accordingly if you are loading a earlier version
atlas=/opt/fsl-6.0.7.16/data/atlases/HarvardOxford/HarvardOxford-cort-maxprob-thr25-2mm.nii.gz
```
Agian in your *fsl* terminal, open the atlas' associated XML file to find region index that is associated the Juxtapositional Lobule Cortex (formerly Supplementary Motor Cortex).  

In your *fsl* terminal: 
``` bash
more /opt/fsl-6.0.7.16/data/atlases/HarvardOxford-Cortical.xml 
```

> Note: FSL indexing generally 0-based. Add 1 to the index to locate ROI voxel value. 

Continue in *fsl* terminal, 
```bash
# Extract with fslmaths
fslmaths $atlas -thr 26 -uthr 26 -bin JLC

# Use `fsleyes` to verify ROIs visually; open a MNI standardized brain template to see the relative position
fsleyes JLC &
```

## Move ROI to Native Space (cf. Lab 4)

Using fsl function *flirt* (FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool) to transform standard space mask (JLC.nii) into native space using pre-estimated transformation matrix, the output falls in the your Lab_6 directory (reg/standard2example_func.mat). 

> Make sure you use the name you set for your sequence pilot output feat directory in Lab 4 to swap out “YOUR_OUTPUT.feat” in the following command to be able to locate the local space reference image and transformation matrix.

In *fsl* terminal: 
```bash
flirt -in JLC.nii.gz \
  -ref ~/Lab_4/YOUR_OUTPUT.feat/example_func.nii.gz \
  -out standardMask2example_func_JLC \
  -applyxfm \
  -init ~/Lab_4/YOUR_OUTPUT.feat/reg/standard2example_func.mat \
  -datatype float
```

Threshold away voxels of lower intensity in *fsl* terminal:
```bash
fslmaths standardMask2example_func_JLC -thr 0.5 standardMask2example_func_JLC
```
Then binarize the mask (i.e., make within-ROI voxels 1s and out-ROI 0s) 
```bash
fslmaths standardMask2example_func_JLC -bin standardMask2example_func_JLC
```

## Extract Average Activation from Seed Region

```bash
fslmeants -i ~/ds005085/sub-10015/func/sub-10015_task-sharedreward_acq-mb3me1_bold.nii.gz \
  -m ~/Lab_6/standardMask2example_func_JLC.nii.gz \
  -o sub-10015_task-sharedreward-task_mb3me1_JLC.txt
```
The output is the average activation of that region in each volume of your subject across time
![Figure](images/lab06_image12.png)

**Note**: you can also run this type of command on specific regions from your L1 activation results (e.g., L1 activation.feat/cluster_mask_zstat1.nii.gz) without doing any additional normalization/registration. For example, if you wanted the second cluster from your cluster_mask_zstat3.nii.gz file, you would run the following command (review your FEAT output and look at these images in fslview if this step does not make sense): 

```bash
fslmaths cluster_mask_zstat3.nii.gz -thr 2 -uthr 2 cluster2 -bin
```

## Setting Up PPI Analyses in FEAT

### 5.1 Open FEAT

```bash
Feat &
```
Keep the default settings of First-level analysis and Full analysis are selected at the top of the Feat window.

### 5.2 Data Tab

- Load BOLD data:  
  `~/ds005085/sub-10015/func/sub-10015_task-sharedreward_acq-mb3me1_bold.nii.gz`
- Name output directory: `~/Lab_6/OUTPUT.feat`

---

### 5.3 Pre-stats Tab

- MCFLIRT for Motion correction 
- BET for brain extraction 
- 5 for spatial smoothing FWHM (mm)
- Highpass for Temporal filtering
- MELODIC ICA data exploration turned on (we will compare this output with feat outputs) 

<img width="504" height="406" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7343eb1d-ceba-401a-af0c-40da74a49627" />

Note that in your report.html output under the pre-stats section you should also see a link for MELODIC Data Exploration. Click on that link and view the output. You should see that MELODIC has reduced your data into a set of components (think back to the lecture and textbook and ask questions if this isn’t clear). Some of the spatial maps and time courses may resemble what you see in your GLM results. 


### 5.4 Registration Tab

- Structural: `~/ds005085/sub-10015/anat/sub-10015_T1w_bet.nii.gz`  
- Linear options: Use BBR and standard MNI defaults

- Standard space option: Leave as default  (MNI152_T1_2mm_brain)
- Linear options: Use Normal search and 12 DOF.
